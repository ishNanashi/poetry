# Instructions

The Poet

Using Angular if possible or javascript or typescript, complete the following and be ready to execute and explain your work during the interview:
        1. Review the  https://poetrydb.org/ api.
        2. Write a script or webpage to make rest calls to the server (author and title endpoint) and inspect the response.
        3. The script should throw an error if a 200 is not received.
        4. Enhance the script to retrieve both author and title by name and log all relevant data.
        5. Be prepared to expand the functionality of your solution during the interview.


# The Poet

Make RESTful calls to the poetrydb.org endpoint.

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 20.0.5.
    - Note that you will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) as a prerequisite to use the Angular CLI.

You will need to install sweetalert2 for parts of this app to work: `npm install sweetalert2`

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
